## About Me

Full-stack engineer specializing in backend APIs, distributed systems, and platform engineering. I have spent 13+ years building scalable systems, from bioinformatics platforms processing 100,000+ weekly jobs to internal tooling supporting millions of concurrent players at Electronic Arts.

I architect solutions with Node.js and Python, design RESTful and GraphQL APIs, and create developer tools that make infrastructure manageable. Whether migrating monoliths to microservices or building CLI tools in Rust, I focus on systems that scale and teams that succeed.
